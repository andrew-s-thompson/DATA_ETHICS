# DATA_ETHICS

I decided that because one of my final research papers for a freshman seminar class was related to my majors of choice, I would make it accessible here to display my work. 

This document was important to include in my Github profile because it introduces a shift from solely data science and computer science applications (programs, models, analysis) and instead approaches the field in a written researched format. It is important to have communication skills to bring high efficiency and productivity to a work and academic environment, so skills regarding communication, research, writing, and philosophical/ethical considerations in the workplace display important characteristics of a worker. This is one of my projects that come from a liberal arts education, allowing me to bring my field of study to a sometimes underutilized field: written communication to an audience.
